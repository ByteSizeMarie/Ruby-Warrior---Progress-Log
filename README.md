# Ruby Warrior - Progress Log

Welcome to my Ruby Warrior repository! üéØ 

This project documents my progress while learning Ruby through the Ruby Warrior game.  
It includes solutions to levels, skills gained, and my reflections on the learning process.

I divided my progress into days to keep track of my learning journey step by step. In each day's folder, you will find three files:

1. **Level File** (e.g., Level 1-2.md)
   * This file contains the code I wrote to solve the specific levels of Ruby Warrior. It also includes the description of the level. This file serves as a record of my practical coding experience.

2. **Learnings File** (e.g., learnings.md)
   * Here, I document the key concepts and Ruby syntax I learned that day. I explain how certain methods work, any new Ruby features I discovered, and any syntax rules I had to get familiar with. This file helps track my technical growth and understanding of Ruby.

3. **Reflections File** (e.g., reflections.md)
   * In this file, I note down my thoughts and feelings about the learning process. I reflect on the challenges I encountered, how I overcame them, and any insights I gained. I also share what worked well and what didn‚Äôt, which helps me assess my progress and reflect on my learning journey.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This repository contains full level descriptions and level solutions. Proceed with caution if you want to avoid spoilers!
