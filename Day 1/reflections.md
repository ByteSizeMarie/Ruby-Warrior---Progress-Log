# Day 1 - Reflections

After installing Ruby and Ruby Warrior, I needed to find a suitable workflow. Initially, I used the Windows Editor app to open and edit the changing ReadMe file, while opening another window to modify the player.rb file. To start the game, I launched the command prompt and ran the command ruby warrior, creating a character to begin the game.

At first, I felt a bit lost. I had expected the game to teach me more about Ruby itself. Having studied Python before, Ruby's syntax felt familiar — especially the indentation rules — but I noticed a few key differences, like the absence of colons after a paragraph. The biggest adjustment was that every condition or block needed to be explicitly closed with an end.

The first two levels were straightforward and easy to grasp, with no major surprises beyond the use of end. However, when I reached level 3, things quickly became frustrating. I struggled to understand the overall syntax and wasn’t sure what commands or structures were allowed. This led me to pause and dive deeper into Ruby through research and reading.

I ended the first day feeling still a bit frustrated but also more informed. Despite the challenges, I was determined to do it better the following day.
