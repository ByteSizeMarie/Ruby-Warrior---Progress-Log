# Day 1 - Learnings

## Ruby Installation
- Successfully installed Ruby and Ruby Warrior on my system.

## Syntax
- In Ruby, an "end" is required after every **class**, **method**, **array**, or **condition**.
  - Example:
    """
    if condition
       Code
    end
    """
- **No colon** (`:`) needed to separate statements.
- **# is used for comments** 

## Abilities

    - Action
        - warrior.walk!
        - warrior.attack!
