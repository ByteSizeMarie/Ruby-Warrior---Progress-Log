# Day 2 - Reflections

Day two began with additional research. Armed with the knowledge that Ruby’s logical operators come in different forms, I approached Level 3 with more confidence. The challenge was straightforward, but I quickly realized I could only perform one action per turn. This limitation forced me to combine actions using an if-elsif-else statement. Without it, solving the level would have been impossible.

Level 4, however, was a different story. It felt overwhelming. I faced two Sludges and an Archer, and the only hint was to track a @health instance variable. While I managed to implement that, I soon hit a wall. What next? After nearly an hour of trial and error, multiple defeats, and rising frustration, I decided to step away. A coffee break and some time cuddling with my cat helped clear my mind.

When I returned, I still couldn’t defeat the level. Reluctantly, I turned to ChatGPT for help. Although I wished I didn’t need assistance, the response provided valuable insights: I had to nest my conditions more deeply than I initially thought. Interestingly, even ChatGPT needed a few tries to get it right. The suggested solution introduced some new concepts, such as the private keyword and duplicate methods, which puzzled me. Despite my questions, the code worked, so I decided to move forward and explore these concepts later.

Level 5 introduced a new twist: captives to rescue. I wondered if I could adapt the solution from Level 4 (thanks again, ChatGPT!) with minor adjustments. I added a simple if condition and converted taking_damage? into an elsif. To my surprise, it worked! I felt a sense of accomplishment but also lingering guilt about needing help with the previous level.

Satisfied with my progress but mentally exhausted, I called it a day, ready to tackle the next challenge after some well-deserved rest.
